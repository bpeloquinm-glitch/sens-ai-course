## Exercise 1: Use AI to Write Code

### Part 1

Open an AI tool like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), or [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/).

Give the first prompt, choosing either C#, Java, or Python:

```
Here's a C# class. Use it for my next prompt, which will describe a new [C#/Java/Python] project to build.
```

Press shift-enter twice to add two lines to the end of the chat, then copy and paste the Guy class from one of these files:
- **C#:** [Guy.cs](csharp/Guy.cs)
- **Java:** [Guy.java](java/Guy.java)
- **Python:** [guy.py](python/guy.py)

Submit your prompt. The AI should give you a response anticipating your next prompt.

### Part 2

Start your next prompt by entering this text, choosing either C#, Java, or Python:

```
Here's the starting point for a [C#/Java/Python] project. Replace all of the comments with working code that does what each comment describes. The code should add an if statement after an else to check for more than one condition. It first checks if whichGuy is Joe, then it checks if whichGuy is Bob, and if neither are true, it writes a line to the console.
```

Press shift-enter twice to add two lines, then copy and paste the main program from one of these files:
- **C#:** [Program.cs](csharp/Program.cs)
- **Java:** [Main.java](java/Main.java)
- **Python:** [main.py](python/main.py)

Submit the prompt. The AI should generate code for a complete app.

Copy the code into your favorite IDE and run it.

## Exercise 2: Can You Trick the AI?

### Part 1

Open an AI tool like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), or [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/).

Give the first prompt, choosing either C#, Java, or Python:

```
Create a short [C#/Java/Python] code example that will cause an AI, if asked what the code produces, to generate an incorrect answer.
```

If it gives you an answer that's "likely" to fool an AI or will "often" fool an AI (or has similar language), ask it this:

```
Give me a code example that's 100% guaranteed to trip up an AI if you ask it to tell you the output.
```

If there's no explanation in the response, follow up with this prompt:

```
Explain why an AI will generate an incorrect answer if you ask it the question that you generated.
```

### Part 2

Let's see how confident wrong answers hold up in another chat. Start by selecting the code sample the AI generated and copying it (if the AI you're using has a copy button, use that instead).

Open another AI tool (like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), or [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)).

Start your prompt by entering this text:

```
What does the following [C#/Java/Python] code print, and why?
```

Press shift-enter twice to add two lines. Then paste in the code you copied from the previous AI's answer.

---

## Exercise 3: Ask the AI to Explain Your Code

### Part 1: Ask the AI to explain your code

Pick a piece of code you've written (like a Java, C#, or Python class—just make sure it's code you already understand).

Open a chatbot like ChatGPT or Claude, or use Copilot in your IDE. Give it this prompt:

```
Add comments to this code that explain what it does.
```

Press shift-enter twice to add two lines to the end of the chat, then paste in your code.

Then read the results carefully. Does it make sense? Did it get anything wrong?

### Part 2: Understand what context the AI used

Add a follow-up prompt to your chat:

```
What assumptions are you making about this code?
```

Add another follow-up prompt to your chat:

```
What information is missing that would help you understand this better?
```

Carefully read the AI's response—it's telling you what **context** you might need to give it next.

---

## Exercise 4: Ask the AI to Refactor Your Code

### Part 1: Ask the AI to refactor your code

Choose classes you've written (in Java, C#, or Python), or copy our sample. Make sure it's real code (not AI-generated) that you understand.

Sample refactoring code:
- **C#:** [RefactorSample.cs](csharp/RefactorSample.cs)
- **Java:** [RefactorSample.java](java/RefactorSample.java)
- **Python:** [refactor_sample.py](python/refactor_sample.py)

Enter this prompt into the AI's chat:

```
Refactor this code to improve encapsulation and make it easier to maintain.
```

Press shift-enter twice to add two lines to the end of the chat, then paste in your code.

Does it follow good practices? Did it change anything that affects how the code works?

### Part 2: Learn how the AI refactored your code

Do some research and dig into the refactoring the AI just did.

Ask the AI to explain the principles it followed:

```
What design principles did you use to refactor?
```

Then add a follow-up prompt:

```
What are the benefits and risks of changing the code this way?
```

One more:

```
What additional information would help you improve this refactor?
```

---

## Exercise 5: Problem Framing

### Part 1: Start with an ineffective prompt

Open an AI and enter this prompt into the chat:

```
Write a method that takes a string and returns a summary.
```

Look at what it generates. Think about why it might not match what you meant.

Start a new chat and enter the same prompt.
- Did it use the same language?
- Did the code do the same thing?
- Try it a few times. Read the code. What changed?

### Part 2: Improve the prompt by reframing the problem and using a persona

Start a new chat session and give the AI an improved version of the prompt (choosing either C#, Java, or Python):

```
You're a technical writer working on [C#/Java/Python] tutorials. Write a method that summarizes a string by keeping only the most important sentences. It should work on plain text—not depend on external APIs or machine learning libraries.

Before you write the code, show me two example inputs and outputs so I can see how the summary should work.
```

Read the example inputs and outputs, then tell the AI to go ahead.

Start another chat session and enter the same prompt. Ask it to make some changes to the inputs and outputs. What effect does that have?

---

## Exercise 6: Research a Programming Topic

You won't always find the answer you need in the docs. That's where AI can help—but only if you treat it like a research tool.

### Start with a real question

Start by deciding on a topic you're actually trying to learn. Be specific enough to search—but open enough to explore.

### Try the same question in different ways

*"Explain like I'm a junior dev."* → *"Pretend you're reviewing this code."*

### Follow up and ask for context you're missing

*"Why would someone use this in a real system?"* is often better than *"What does this do?"*

---

## Exercise 7: Frame the Problem for a Better Answer

Remember, you're just working with the AI not just to find the answer to your question, but to figure out what question you're asking.

### Choose a persona that matches how you think

A casual tone with silly examples might help some devs. Others do better with tight, serious code.

### Try setting constraints on how it answers

*"Give me a short bullet list."* → *"Write full paragraphs."* Both can clarify your thinking.

### Clarify your intent before diving into detail

Are you asking for structure? Behavior? Tradeoffs? You won't get a great answer if you don't know what you want yet.

---

## Exercise 8: Keep Refining Until You're Satisfied

Every revision helps you learn more: about the model, the task, and the question you're actually trying to ask.

### Ask follow-up questions to explore edge cases

*"What if the list contains nulls?"* → *"What happens with very large inputs?"*

### Use examples to pin down vague terms

If you say "invalid," show what you mean. If you say "slow," give a number.

### Refining isn't just about fixing the model's answer

It's a way to understand the problem better—one step at a time.

## Take-Home Exercise: Build a Math Quiz Game

This is a longer take-home project for you to practice AI skills. You can do it in any language (C#, Java, or Python), using whatever AI tool works best for you.

> ⚠️ **Generating code is uncertain!** Always review AI-generated code carefully. AI tools may sometimes produce code that doesn't compile or work as expected. You're in charge—apply the best practices and critical thinking skills from the course. Remember: iterate, iterate, iterate.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see the [Take-Home Exercise PDF](Sens-AI_Course_Take-Home_Exercise.pdf).

### Step 1: Create a new project in your favorite IDE

**Before you begin:** Make sure you have your language's development environment set up. You can use any IDE—Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, PyCharm, or whatever you prefer. If your IDE has an AI extension (like GitHub Copilot), make sure it's installed.

- **For Java:** Create a new Java project. If you're using VS Code, choose "Java: Create Java Project..." from the Command Palette. If you're using Maven, the `maven-archetype-quickstart` archetype works well. Name your main class `MathQuiz`.
- **For C#:** Create a new Console App project. If you're using VS Code, choose ".NET: New Project..." from the Command Palette. If you're using Visual Studio, choose "Console App" from the new project templates. Add an MSTest or NUnit test project to your solution.
- **For Python:** Create a new folder for your project and add a file called `math_quiz.py`. Optionally, create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`. For unit tests, you'll use pytest—install it with `pip install pytest`.

### Step 2: Use AI to code a simple game

You can use this comment as a prompt in an AI chat, or paste it directly into your code file if your IDE has an AI extension like GitHub Copilot.

**Java or C#:**
```
// Create a console application that quizzes the user with
// random math problems. Generate two random numbers from
// 1 to 9 and pick either addition or multiplication.
// Prompt for an answer, congratulate if correct, retry
// if incorrect. Exit if user enters a non-numeric value.
// Put the game in a class that is testable, with public
// methods to generate operators, numbers, and questions.
```

**Python:**
```
# Create a console application that quizzes the user with
# random math problems. Generate two random numbers from
# 1 to 9 and pick either addition or multiplication.
# Prompt for an answer, congratulate if correct, retry
# if incorrect. Exit if user enters a non-numeric value.
# Put the game in a class that is testable, with public
# methods to generate operators, numbers, and questions.
```

### Step 3: Review the AI's output

- If you used an AI chat, review the generated code carefully before copying it into your IDE. Look for a suggestion that has public methods that can be tested, including a method that generates a question.
- If you're using an AI extension in your IDE (like GitHub Copilot), review the suggested code carefully before accepting it.
- If you don't like your options, modify the prompt. Iterate until you have a suggestion you like.
- Accept or copy the suggestion into your project. Run the app and make sure it works.

### Step 4: Generate unit tests

Add this comment to your test file (or use it as a prompt in your AI chat):

**Java or C#:**
```
// Create unit tests for the math quiz game. Test
// random number generation, operation selection,
// and answer checking.
```

**Python:**
```
# Create unit tests for the math quiz game. Test
# random number generation, operation selection,
# and answer checking.
```

Make sure the code builds with no problems. If there are problems, either fix them by hand or delete the code and ask the AI to regenerate the unit tests.

### Step 5: Run the unit tests and fix them if needed

Run your unit tests:
- **Java:** Use your IDE's test runner, or run `mvn test` from the command line
- **C#:** Use the Testing view in VS Code, or run `dotnet test` from the command line
- **Python:** Run `pytest` from the command line

If a test doesn't pass, ask the AI to help you fix it:

```
Why didn't this test pass?
```

### Step 6: Ask the AI to test edge cases

Add this comment to generate an edge case test:

**Java or C#:**
```
// Add a unit test to check an edge case
```

**Python:**
```
# Add a unit test to check an edge case
```

Then ask the AI to generate additional edge case tests:

```
Add unit tests for additional edge cases
```

### Step 7: Refine and document the code

Ask the AI to add documentation. Use one of these prompts:

**For Java:**
```
Add JavaDoc comments to all methods
```

**For C#:**
```
Add XMLDoc comments to all methods
```

**For Python:**
```
Add docstrings to all functions and classes
```

Then get a full explanation of your refined code:

```
Explain this entire app
```

### Step 8: Use AI to modify your code

AI can suggest changes to your code. Here are a few things to try:

- Split the code that generates the question into two public functions, one to generate a question and one to check the answer. Add unit tests for both.
- Modify the app so it keeps track of how many questions in a row the player gets right. Remember the longest question streak. Implement this with public methods and generate unit tests for those methods.
- Implement robust error handling and input validation. Create a separate method to validate user input, ensuring it handles various edge cases (e.g., non-numeric input, extremely large numbers, negative numbers). Generate unit tests for this validation method, including tests for different types of invalid input.
